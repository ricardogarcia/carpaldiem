Carpal Diem - Pedometer for typing

CD keeps only a raw count of each keypress and uses the detection of the space character to determine word demarcations.

By detecting any keypress and using space char to indicate the delimiter between words,
it's able to keep a raw hourly,daily, monthly, yearly count of your raw keystrokes.

The hope is to couple this data from research from hand orthopedics to determine the average intervals
when a programer, typist, etc should take a break and do restorative exercises for their wrists.

Eventually, this could connect you to live hand orthopedists.

The code that monitors keystrokes should be open source and peer reviewed so that one can feel confident
that no one is stealing your ideas or reading your emails.
